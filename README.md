Will copy Photos Form a what Ever you plug into the KODI box


BUT looks at date taken if it can't find taken date 
it will use the last modified date
it will create a year folder and then the month folder.	

Destination - Year - ## ### - files [From Target]

% %%% = month number then the month name only did for sorting so it looks right

so
-destination folder<br><br>
   |- 2016 -script create it  <br>
      |-  1 Jan -script create it<br>
          |-  photo.jpg -script copy it form target<br>
      |-  2 Feb -script create it<br>
      |-  3 Mar -script create it<br>

for the last 5 year its been doing its job last count over 38,000 photos from 2000
which are sorted in the above format

as the mark 1 verson was vbscript
								
KODI MUST BE ABLE TO WRITE TO THE DESTINATION FOLDER
